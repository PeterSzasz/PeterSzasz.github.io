## Welcome

This site is for my hobby programming projects. To show what was the purpose of them.
Right now all of them in Python3, but some PHP is in the planning.

In the last few month I worked on a Tetris game to fiddle with pyglets basic graphics capabilities and I ended up implementing a cool State Pattern. Before that was a pomodoro desktop app using platform independent PyQT and custom graphics.
Then I refactored/rebuilt my earlier Arcade/pyglet platformer game. Got a nice State pattern for app states, physics, replay system, test capabilities, enemy/difficult system with a Factory Method pattern, etc. I plan to add more levels, mini-rpg-like attribute system and a bunch more eventually.
But in the coming weeks I want to reach a playable state and then move onto the GraphApp.
That Graph desktop app is a generator, also in PyQT. It can show you some nice nodes and lines but nothing more. The main goal of that project is to generate a graph based Map. Nice features would be graphics, to be able to export that graph/map and to use more (configurable) algorithms.

Earlier this year I started working on a few mini projects to try things. Basically every project was for one or two specific technic, api, etc.
For example in Pomodoro I wanted to create an app with a custom pixelated window 'skin', like in the 90's, in python.

`Pomodoro` uses Qt's python binding PyQt5.

In `ttrs` I was curious what can be done to create some custom graphics in code using pyglet.

`Pltfrmr` started as a python arcade library experiment and then it outgrow itself.

Last but not least the `GraphApp`. Generate nodes (quasi) randomly or with some clever algorithms and connect them randomly or with some clever algorithms.

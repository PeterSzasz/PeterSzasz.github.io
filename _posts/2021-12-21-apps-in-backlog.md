Earlier this year I started working on a few mini projects to try things. Basically every project was for one or two specific technic, api, etc.
For example in Pomodoro I wanted to create an app with a custom pixelated window 'skin', like in the 90's, in python.

[Pomodoro]({% post_url 2021-12-22-pomodoro-app %}) uses Qt's python binding PyQt5. And handmade graphics.

In [ttrs]({% post_url 2021-12-25-ttrs-app %}) I was curious what can be done to create some custom graphics in code using pyglet.

[Pltfrmr]({% post_url 2021-12-27-platformer-game-1 %}), [second part]({% post_url 2022-01-11-platformer-game-2 %}) started as a python arcade library experiment and then it outgrow itself.

Last but not least the GraphApp. Generate nodes (quasi) randomly or with some clever algorithms and connect them randomly or with some clever algorithms.

A mind map of what can be expected:

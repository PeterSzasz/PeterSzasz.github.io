Earlier this year I started working on a few mini projects to try things. Basically every project was for one or two specific technic, api, etc.
For example in Pomodoro I wanted to create an app with a custom pixelated window 'skin', like in the 90's, in python.

[Pomodoro]({% post_url 2021-12-22-pomodoro-app %}) uses Qt's python binding PyQt5. And handmade graphics.

In [ttrs]({% post_url 2021-12-25-ttrs-app %}) I was curious what can be done to create some custom graphics in code using pyglet.

[Pltfrmr]({% post_url 2021-12-27-platformer-game-1 %}), [second part]({% post_url 2022-01-11-platformer-game-2 %}) started as a python arcade library experiment and then it outgrow itself.

Last but not least the [GraphApp]({% post_url 2022-01-06-graph-app %}). Generate nodes (quasi) randomly or with some clever algorithms and connect them randomly or with some clever algorithms.

A mind map of what can be expected:

A platformer game needs more than just graphics and movement logic. It needs an event system (Observer), input handling (Strategy) and some kind of process management.
<!--more-->

MVC was among the first that came in mind, but as it turns out if you are using a library like arcade half of the problems are already solved in this matter. Right now I only added Observer for Model and Strategy for Controller. Right now both handles player movement, the main reason behind every change, but different aspects of it. View part of MVC is what pyglet created for, so not much to do there, but maybe when I extend the GUI capabilities a Composite pattern might come in handy.
I'm planning to extend Observer to menu navigation, sound triggering and handling game logic changes, if these parts mature enough.

The Input handling contains three classes. A base class called `BaseInput` and two that inherits this: `KeyboardInput` and `ControllerInput`. Because arcade and pyglet does a realy good job about basic input handling (at least for keyboard and mouse clicks) the main purpose of these classes is to just hide all the quirks. This way the `Gameplay` class can focus on its own stuff and doesn't even know if the input is through a controller or keyboarg or something else.
Right now as I mentioned the menu clicks/enters is still handled directly in the State classes, but I'm plannig to move all that to the logic section or somehow into the input classes (not likely) or into their own menu-logic-and-descriptor class.

As for implementation of the Observer pattern pyglet have an event handling system already with all the event registering, storing, notifying, etc. So `Gameplay` and the `*Input` classes inherit from `pyglet.event.EventDispatcher` also. The keyboard and the minimalistic controller presses and releases all dispatch an appropriate, registered event. The `MainActor` and a `MovementLogger` classes catches the relevant ones and reacts.

actors.py
{% highlight python %}
class MainActor(AnimatedWalkingSprite):
...
    def setup_subject(self, input_subject):
        input_subject.push_handlers(self)

    # catches event by name
    def move_left(self, moving):
    ...
...
{% endhighlight %}
states.py
{% highlight python %}
from pyglet.event import EventDispatcher

class Gameplay(BaseState, EventDispatcher):
    def __init__(self,...)
        ...
        self.player.setup_subject(self)
        ...
    def on_key_press(...)
        if symbol == arcade.key.LEFT:
            self.dispatch_event('move_left',True)
        ...
    ...

Gameplay.register_event_type('move_left')

{% endhighlight %}

Oh yea, the `MovementLogger` class is a great thing. It not just logs the movement events to the console but stores them as a list of timed movement actions in a file, which then can be 'interpreted' by a `LogReplay`. This means that you can replay previous player movements with a few hundreth seconds accuracy. This I want to use for automatic testing and/or for player-created-combo-sets. All great and interesting features and all based on a simple Observer pattern.

I wanted to do something with graphs. Generating algorithms seemed a good choice and after I found a very good article about map generation I started building an app. It is now capable of some Voronoi and a little Delaunay based generation.

As a GUI centric app PyQT5 was a natural choice. Easy to build a button and widget toolbar on the side and update a central canvas for graphics. ...

There were some efforts creating a system where first you can create some dots on the white canvas based on a selected algorithm and then a second step would be to connect them by an other algorithm, creating a graph in the way. A major refactoring for the GUI is next if I want to realise this. ...

A breadth first graph traversal was realised early and quickly developed with its help a spanning tree detecting and highlighting method too. ...

A Delaunay class calculates a Delaunay triangulation with the help of Bowyer–Watson algorithm. And as a sideffect returns not just this but also a complementer Voronoi node set.

Tetris is a game with very few rules. But to implement these and the game scene you have to learn at least one thing that the pieces are called tetrominos, sometimes.

I did not know that and still kept replacing some 'i' with an 'o' here and there in that word and then correcting them. Then it turned out Tetriminos is the official name since 2001, so I guess I was always right. Maybe someone mixed those up in the Tetris Committee also, I imagine fights over this up until 2001 when a new era started.

Anyway, the projects base idea was to try pyglet without external assets. Create a game with just lines and pixels, implement a minimalistic menu system on top of this and make it playable. For a while I was planning to create some simple sound effects too. Generating a few sinus based tones with different amplitude and/or frequency values is easy. Then you just have to experiment a little on how to combine them to some comforting bleeps and blops for your mini-game-project. This sound business remains to an other project for this I found some good underwater beeps and bloops.

The State pattern here is based on this `GameState` class which contains only method declarations, basically an abstract class without any implementation. A `Menu`, `Running` and `Scores` classes inherit from this base class.
Because of the simplicity of the project the state classes contains not just the graphic generations and the objects necessary to play tetris but the logic for the gui, sound effects and input handling.
